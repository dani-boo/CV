## Danielle Booysen

A professional jazz pianist, composer and arranger, I'm thrilled to now swap the stage & studio for Makers Academy and rightfully call myself a skilled software developer in the making.
(Also an erstwhile copywriter, although I find constructing code far more satisfying than penning press releases.)

(Then a sentence about what you've achieved.)


I am particularly interested in meaningful UX; making accessible web stuff that looks good **and** works well. My ideal workplace provides a product/service founded in ethical practices, and the opportunity to take on, solve, and learn from challenges with peers who are as passionate about programming as I am.
